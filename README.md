# Image-Compression-Using-KMeans-Clusstering
It is a simple image compression technique that reduces the number of colors in an image to the desired number by using K-Means clustering unsupervised technique on input images. Thereby reducing the size of images

There are two types of image compression files here:

1. Jupyter Notebook: An interactive image compression system where you can select image to be compressed and number of colors on image.

2. Python File: Containg function to see and analyse original and compressed image with manually given k(number of colors in compressed image)

Further more, plot_utils.py contains helping class used by above mentioned jupyter notebook , which is used to visualize color space of the images.
